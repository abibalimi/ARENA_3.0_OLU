## Exercises - einops operations (match images)
## Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
## Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª
## You should spend up to ~45 minutes on these exercises collectively.
## If you think you get the general idea, then you can skip to the next section.
## You shouldn't spend longer than ~10 mins per exercise.

### (1) Column stacking
arr1 = einops.rearrange(arr, "b c h w -> c (b h) w")
display_array_as_img(arr1)  # plotting all images, stacked in a column

### (2) Column-stacking and copying
#### In this example we take just the first digit, and copy it along rows using einops.repeat.
arr2 = einops.repeat(arr[0], "c h w -> c (2 h) w")
display_array_as_img(arr2)

### (3) Row-stacking and double-copying
#### This example is pretty similar to the previous one, except that the part of the original image we need to slice 
#### and pass into einops.repeat also has a batch dimension of 2 (since it includes the first 2 digits).
arr3 = einops.repeat(arr[:2], "b c h w -> c (b h) (2 w)")
display_array_as_img(arr3)

### (4) Stretching
#### The image below was stretched vertically by a factor of 2.
arr4 = einops.repeat(arr[0], "c h w -> c (h 2) w")
display_array_as_img(arr4)

### (5) Split channels
#### The image below was created by splitting out the 3 channels of the image (i.e. red, green, blue) 
#### and turning these into 3 stacked horizontal images. 
#### The output is 2D (the display function interprets this as a monochrome image).
arr5 = einops.rearrange(arr[0], "c h w -> h (c w)")
display_array_as_img(arr5)

### (6) Stack into rows & cols
#### This requires a rearrange operation with dimensions for row and column stacking.
arr6 = einops.rearrange(arr, "(b1 b2) c h w -> c (b1 h) (b2 w)", b1=2)
display_array_as_img(arr6)

### (7) Transpose
#### Here, we've just flipped the model's horizontal and vertical dimensions. 
#### Transposing is a fairly common tensor operation.
arr7 = einops.rearrange(arr[1], "c h w -> c w h")
display_array_as_img(arr7)

### (8) Shrinking
#### Hint - for this one, you should use max pooling - i.e. 
#### each pixel value in the output is the maximum of the corresponding 2x2 square in the original image.
arr8 = einops.reduce(arr, "(b1 b2) c (h h1) (w w1) -> c (b1 h) (b2 w)", "max", b1=2, h1=2, w1=2)
display_array_as_img(arr8)

## You should spend up to ~45 minutes on these exercises collectively.

### (A1) rearrange
#### We'll start with a simple rearrange operation -
#### you're asked to return a particular tensor using only t.arange and einops.rearrange.
#### The t.arange function is similar to the numpy equivalent:
#### torch.arange(start, end) will return a 1D tensor containing all the values from start to end - 1 inclusive.

### (B1) temperature average
#### Here you're given a 1D tensor containing temperatures for each day.
#### You should return a 1D tensor containing the average temperature for each week.
#### This could be done in 2 separate operations (a reshape from 1D to 2D followed by taking the mean over one of the axes),
#### however we encourage you to try and find a solution with einops.reduce in just a single line.

### (B2) temperature difference
#### Here, we're asking you to subtract the average temperature from each week from the daily temperatures.
#### You'll have to be careful of broadcasting here, since your temperatures tensor has shape (14,)
#### while your average temperature computed above has shape (2,) - these are not broadcastable.

### (B3) temperature normalized
#### Lastly, you need to subtract the average and divide by the standard deviation. 
#### Note that you can pass t.std into the einops.reduce function to return the std dev of the values you're reducing over.

### (C1) normalize a matrix
#### Here, we're asking you to normalize the rows of a matrix so that each row has L2 norm (sum of squared values) equal to 1.
#### Note - L2 norm and standard deviation are not the same thing; L2 norm leaves out the averaging over size of vector step.
#### We recommend you try and use the torch function t.norm directly rather than einops for this task.
#### Two useful things we should highlight here:
#### Most PyTorch functions like t.norm(tensor, ...) which operate on a single tensor are also tensor methods, i.e.
#### they can be used as tensor.norm(...) with the same arguments.
#### Most PyTorch dimensionality-reducing functions have the keepdim argument,
#### which is false by default but will cause your output tensor to keep dummy dimensions if set to true.
#### For example, if tensor has shape (3, 4) then tensor.sum(dim=1) has shape (3,) but tensor.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True) has shape (3, 1).
def normalize_rows(matrix: Tensor) -> Tensor:

### (C2) pairwise cosine similarity
#### Now, you should compute a matrix of shape (m, m)
#### where out[i, j] is the cosine similarity between the i-th and j-th rows of matrix.
#### The cosine similarity between two vectors is given by summing the elementwise products of the normalized vectors.
#### We haven't covered einsum yet, but you should be able to get this working using normal elementwise multiplication
#### and summing (or even do this in one step - can you see how?).

### (D) sample distribution
#### Here we're having you do something a bit more practical and less artificial.

### (E) classifier accuracy

#### where scores[b, i] is the score the classifier gave to class i for input b, and true_classes is a tensor of shape (batch,)
#### where true_classes[b] is the true class for input b.
#### We want you to return the fraction of times the maximum score is equal to the true class.
#### You can use the torch function t.argmax, it works as follows:

#### (i.e. the shape of this output will be the same as the shape of tensor except for the dimension dim).
